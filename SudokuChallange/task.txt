Sudoku
The basic rules of Sudoku are that in the 9x9 grid, a single 1–9 digit is not to be repeated in any row, column, or 3x3 square that makes up the puzzle.
There are some digits already inserted in the puzzle and some blank.
Write a function check_cell(grid, value, x, y) that receives:
Grid: list of lists representing the grid of the game 9x9 with values from 0 to 9 (0 values represent ‘empty’ cells)
Value: an integer from 1 to 9
X: integers from 0 to 8 as coordinate
Y: integers from 0 to 8 as coordinate
X,Y pair represents a position on the grid while value represents a possible suggestion for the number to be inserted in that position.
Create a function that returns True if the ‘value’, in position (X,Y), does not violate any of the sudoku rules, return False otherwise.
Examples:
grid = [
[2,9,0,0,0,0,0,7,0],
[3,0,6,0,0,8,4,0,0],
[8,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,2],
[0,2,0,0,3,1,0,0,7],
[0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0],
[1,0,0,9,5,0,0,6,0],
[7,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,1],
[0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,6],
[0,3,0,0,0,0,0,5,9],
]
check_cell(grid, 8, 8, 4) → False
